## Three stags
Three crossing,  
The first two fast,  
The last one stops,  
Eyes locked.  

Gazing to the past.  

Of beasts,  
Prehistoric,  
Wandering the land,  
Not ours.  

Shared uneasily.  

A time  
Forgotten,  
A feeling  
Lost,  
A moment  
Glimpsed.  

The stag stares.  
I shout  
To the woods,  
To safety,  
Away,  
Enclosed.  

The stag stares.  
A moment longer  
Uncomprehending,  
But perhaps  
Feeling  
The injustice,  
The change,  
The alien.  

Into the woods  
I follow  
But soon  
They are gone.
